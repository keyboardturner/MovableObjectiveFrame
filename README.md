# MovableObjectiveFrame
This is just a pretty early version for now, putting out a release for bug testing I guess.

This allows you to resize the Objective Tracker, make the height long or short, and move it around / lock it in place. This is mainly a personal addon for myself and some people wanted me to share it so I don't really plan to add any new features or anything. There's plenty of other bigger and more stylish quest tracker frame addons like Kaliel's Tracker and Hide Objective Tracker and obviously my addon will be incompatible with these two (possibly more).

The quest counter is a separate addon called Simple Quest Counter.
