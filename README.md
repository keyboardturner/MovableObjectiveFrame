# MovableObjectiveFrame
<p>This is just a pretty early version for now, putting out a release for bug testing I guess.</p>
<p>This allows you to resize the Objective Tracker, make the height long or short, and move it around / lock it in place. <strong>This is mainly a personal addon for myself</strong>&nbsp;and some people wanted me to share it so I don't really plan to add any new features or anything. There's plenty of other bigger and more stylish quest tracker frame addons like <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/kaliels-tracker">Kaliel's Tracker</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hideobjectivetracker">Hide Objective Tracker</a>&nbsp;and obviously my addon will be incompatible with these two (possibly more).</p>
<p>The quest counter is a separate addon called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/simple-quest-counter">Simple Quest Counter</a>.</p>
